# Changelog

All notable changes to `@juntia/juntia` are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning follows [semver](https://semver.org/), with the
0.x-specific meaning described in [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md#versioning-while-0x).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

First public release. 0.x — the CLI surface and public API are real and working, but not yet under a
stability guarantee; see [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md#versioning-while-0x) for what that means in
practice.

### Added

- `juntia init` — scaffolds a project-local `.juntia/` context directory.
- `juntia analyze` — deterministic project inventory (languages, dependencies, config files, structure),
  each fact traceable to real evidence; persists a factual baseline to `.juntia/facts.json` and reports
  Added/Removed/Changed against it on every later run.
- `juntia analyze --explain` — a real AI-runtime interpretation of the persisted facts, validated against a
  fact-grounding check, saved as a pending item in `.juntia/pending.json`.
- `juntia confirm` — the only command that can create a decision: walks every pending interpretation and
  asks; a "yes" writes `.juntia/decisions.json` and appends a line to `.juntia/DECISIONS.md`.
- `juntia context` — assembles `.juntia/context.md` from confirmed facts and confirmed decisions only.
- `juntia integrate claude-code` — generates a `CLAUDE.md` pointer file so Claude Code finds
  `.juntia/context.md` on its own, without duplicating its content.
- A public, documented programmatic API (`require('@juntia/juntia')`): `classifyIntent`, `analyzeProduct`,
  `analyzeArchitecture`, `analyzeEngineering`, `interpretIntent`.
- A protected internal/public boundary enforced by `package.json`'s `exports` map — a deep `require()` into
  internal reasoning modules throws, by design.
